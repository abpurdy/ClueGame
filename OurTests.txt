For the door direction test, we selected cells with doors for each different direction. The door in
the library points down, the door in the bathroom points right, the door in the observatory points
up, and the door in the long room points left. We also included a cell from the walkway to make
sure there were no doors there.

For the room type tests, we selected cells that were on the edges of other rooms to make sure that
the rooms were getting loaded into the correct cells and that we weren't one cell off somewhere.
